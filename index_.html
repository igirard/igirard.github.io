		<h1>Hello there! My name is Isaac.</h1>
		<h2>I'm a former IT consultant and senior support tech with a passion for clean design and joyful user experiences.</h2>

		<h3>What I'm doing now:</h3>
		<p>I'm currently a student at Startup Institute, where I'm honing my web design and development skills. I hope to transition into a career in UI/UX and product design, and dream of joining a kick-ass team in the Boston area.</p>

		<h3>What I did before:</h3>
		<p>I've spent the past 6 years helping small businesses and residential clients navigate the increasingly complex world of modern technology; evaluating and implementing hardware, software, and service-based solutions to a wide variety of problems.</p>

		<h3>What I do for fun:</h3>
		<p>I'm a husband, and father of two. I delight in learning, teaching, exploring, and connecting with people. I'm an admirer and occasional designer of logos and brand identity collateral, a hobbyist photographer, and a (very) amateur guitar player.</p>
